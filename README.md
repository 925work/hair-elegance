### Hair Elegance
[Click here for live site.](https://925work.github.io/hair-elegance/) A REAL commissioned project I did for a local business. The owner was in love with this website. She had paid 1,500 dollars previously for one of the worst websites I have ever seen. I was able to charge her less than her previous developer and create an aethetically pleasing site for her and her salon.
